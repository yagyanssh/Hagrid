TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
This is a widely-used technique for converting text into numerical vectors, particularly useful in information retrieval and search engines.

Term Frequency (TF) measures how frequently a term appears in a document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measures how important a term is in the entire corpus of documents (less common terms are more important).
With TF-IDF, you convert the text data into vectors that reflect both the frequency and importance of terms in a specific context. These vectors can then be used to perform more efficient search and ranking based on cosine similarity or other distance metrics.

Example of a project description vector:

Original Project Description: "This project is about machine learning"
TF-IDF Vector: [0.23, 0.56, 0.12, 0.03, ...] (a numerical vector representing the term importance)
You can use libraries like scikit-learn in Python to compute these vectors.
